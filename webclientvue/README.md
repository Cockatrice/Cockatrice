# Routing

### Adding a page to routing

Inside of src/router/routes.ts you'll follow the pattern in the file for the rest of the pages in this app; add an object to the routes array. Specify a path, a layout (things like header/footer) and the page to use.

[Quasar Routing Documentation](https://quasar.dev/layout/routing-with-layouts-and-pages)

### Routing to a page

Let's say you setup the routing already and now you need a way to navigate to a page. This project utilizes [Vue Router](https://router.vuejs.org/guide/advanced/composition-api)

# Additional Info
