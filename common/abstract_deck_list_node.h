/**
 * @file abstract_deck_list_node.h
 * @brief Defines the AbstractDecklistNode base class used as the foundation
 *        for all nodes in the deck list tree (zones, groups, and cards).
 *
 * The deck list is modeled as a tree:
 * - The invisible root node is managed by DeckListModel.
 * - Top-level children are zones (e.g. Mainboard, Sideboard).
 * - Zones contain grouping nodes (e.g. by type, color, or mana cost).
 * - Grouping nodes contain card nodes.
 *
 * This abstract base class provides the interface and shared functionality
 * for all node types. Concrete subclasses (InnerDecklistNode,
 * DecklistCardNode, DecklistModelCardNode, etc.) implement the specifics.

/**
 * @class AbstractDecklistNode
* @ingroup DeckModels
 * @brief Base class for all nodes in the deck list tree.
 *
 * This class defines the common interface for every node in the
 * deck representation: zones, groupings, and cards.
 *
 * Responsibilities:
 * - Maintain a pointer to its parent (if any).
 * - Track the sorting method to be used for child nodes.
 * - Provide a consistent interface for retrieving basic identifying
 *   properties (name, set, collector number, provider ID).
 * - Define abstract methods for XML serialization, used when saving
 *   or loading deck files.
 *
 * Lifetime / Ownership:
 * - Nodes are arranged hierarchically under @c InnerDecklistNode parents.
 * - The parent takes ownership of its children; destruction cascades.
 * - The DeckListModel holds the invisible root node, which in turn
 *   owns the entire hierarchy.
 *
 * Extension:
 * - @c InnerDecklistNode is the concrete subclass representing
 *   "folders" in the tree (zones, groups).
 * - @c DecklistCardNode and @c DecklistModelCardNode represent
 *   actual card entries.
