With the main server inaccessibility recently I was asked by a number of people on how I compiled and hosted the cockatrice server at woogerworks.com. 
In response to these questions, I have written a quick and dirty guide with exact commands to get a basic cockatrice server, the oracle tool, and cockatrice client compiled on CentOS.  
These instructions can also be accessed at WoogerWorks incase this site goes offline for any reason.  
I hope to improve upon the formatting of these steps when I have time, but for now this should help.
Installation script can be downloaded at: http://www.woogerworks.com/cockatrice/installatrice

BEFORE CONTINUING, PLEASE UNDERSTAND THESE ARE THE VERY MOST BASIC STEPS.
THIS WILL NOT CONFIGURE SECURITY SETTINGS (YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR OWN SECURITY)!
THIS WILL NOT CONNECT THE SERVER TO A DB!
USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.

I RECOMMEND RUNNING THE COMMANDS AS ROOT (NOT REQUIRED)
YOU MUST HAVE INTERNET ACCESS

You should be able to log in as a regular user using any account name.
You can login using the username "servatrice" and the password "password" as the first moderator


Things to consider doing:
learn linux!
update the servatrice.ini line that says "max_users_per_address=4" to something alittle higher (maybe max_users_per_address=8)
set your root password to something stong (sounds like a good idea)
if you expect to be running a server only, change your default runlevel to 3
