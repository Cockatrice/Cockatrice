@page creating_decks Creating Decks

Creating a new deck is done using either the \ref editing_decks_classic or \ref editing_decks_visual.

They can be accessed either by clicking the "Create Deck" button in the TabHome screen, which will open the default deck
editor configured in the "User Interface" -> "Deck editor/storage settings" -> "Default deck editor type" setting, or
by selecting "Deck Editor" or "Visual Deck Editor" under the "Tabs" application menu located at the top.
