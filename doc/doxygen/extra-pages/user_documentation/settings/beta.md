@page beta_release Beta Release

The beta version of Cockatrice features all the newest features before they make their way into the latest stable
release.
It allows us to test these features ahead of time and you to give feedback on them.
We release new betas very frequently and usually release a follow-up beta with a fix within a day or two if we break
anything. In contrast, stable releases are released much less frequently but ensured to be stable.

# What to Expect from the Beta

Using the beta and giving feedback on it helps us improve Cockatrice a lot.
We do not perform any automatic data collection so your voluntary feedback is the only way for us to get a sense of what
you enjoy, expect, or would like to change.

We highly appreciate your active participation and feedback.

That being said, some words of warning should be issued:

The beta release may contain unfinished features, bugs, or performance issues.
It is intended for testing and feedback and may be less stable than the default release.

We recommend using the beta only if you are comfortable encountering issues and helping us improve Cockatrice.

# Switching to the Beta

To switch to the Beta, navigate to your settings, using the Tab "Cockatrice → Settings" or Ctrl + Shift + P (default
shortcut).

Within the settings, in the first tab 'General', the first section 'Personal Settings' contains the setting 'Release
Channel'.

Switch this to 'Beta'.

Afterwards, close your settings, and use the 'Help' tab to search for a client update. You should be prompted to install
the beta version.

# Switching back to Stable

Follow the same steps as above, but set Release Channel to 'Default'.
