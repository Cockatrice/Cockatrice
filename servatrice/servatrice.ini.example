; Servatrice configuration file
;
; This is the main configuration file for Servatrice; while using a configuration is not mandatory,
; you may want to customize some aspects of your servatrice instance, like its name, port or the way
; users can authenticate to the server.


[server]

; This is the name that servatrice exposes to the users; the default value is pretty boring
name="My Cockatrice server"

; Multiple servatrice servers can run on the same host using the same database; each server instance
; must have a different id; the default id is 1
id=1

; The TCP port number servatrice will listen on for clients; default is 4747
port=4747

; Servatrice can scale up to serve big number of users using more than one parallel thread of execution;
; If your server is hosting a lot of players and they frequently report of being unable to login or
; long delays (lag), you may want to try increasing this value; default is 1.
; Set to 0 to disable the tcp server.
number_pools=1

; Servatrice can listen for clients on websockets, too. Unfortunately it can't support more than one thread.
; Set to 0 to disable the websocket server.
websocket_number_pools=1

; The TCP port number servatrice will listen on for websockets clients; default is 4748
websocket_port=4748

; When database is enabled, servatrice writes the server status in the "update" database table; this
; setting defines every how many milliseconds servatrice will update its status; default is 15000 (15 secs)
statusupdate=15000

; Do you want servatrice to write important events and errors to a logfile? Default is 1 (yes).
writelog=1

; Choose a name for the log file, if enabled; you can specify an absolute path or a path relative to
; the servatrice executable; the default file name is server.log (in the same path as servatrice)
logfile=server.log

; You may want to silence some commonly recurring messages in the logfile. This setting can contain a
; comma-separed list of words; if any message that is about to be logged contains at least one of these words,
; it won't be logged. Default is empty; example: "kittens,ponies,faires"
logfilters=""

; Set the time interval in seconds that servatrice will use to communicate with each connected client
; to verify the client has not timed out. Defaults is 1 seconds
clientkeepalive=1

; Maximum time in seconds a player can stay inactive with there client not even responding to pings, before is
; considered disconnected; default is 15
max_player_inactivity_time=15

; More modern clients generate client IDs based on specific client side information.  Enable this option to
' require that clients report the client ID in order to log into the server.  Default is false
requireclientid=false

; You can limit the types of clients that connect to the server by requiring different features be available
; on the client.  This setting can contain a comma-seperated list of features.  if any of the features
; listed in this line are not available on the client the client will be denied access to the server upon
; attempting to log in.  Example: "client_id,client_ver"
requiredfeatures=""

; You can define custom warnings that users are sent when the moderation staff uses the right client warn user
; menu option.  This list is comma seperated that each item will appear in the drop down list for staff members
; to choose from.  Example: "Flaming,Foul Language"
officialwarnings="Flamming,Spamming,Causing Drama,Abusive Language"

[authentication]
