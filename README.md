# Cockatrice

Cockatrice is an open-source, multiplatform application for playing tabletop card games over a network. The program's server design prevents users from manipulating the game for unfair advantage. The client also provides a single-player mode, which allows users to brew while offline.<br><br>
This project uses <kbd>C++</kbd> and the <kbd>Qt</kbd> libraries.<br>
First work on a webclient with <kbd>Typescript</kbd> was started as well.<br>

# Contribute

### Code

To contribute code to the project, please review our [guidelines](https://github.com/Cockatrice/Cockatrice/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) first.<br>
We maintain two tags for contributors to easier find issues to potentially work on:
- [![Good first issue](https://img.shields.io/github/issues/cockatrice/cockatrice/Good%20First%20Issue)](https://github.com/Cockatrice/Cockatrice/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen%20is%3Aissue%20label%3A%22Good%20first%20issue%22%20)<br>
Issues tagged in this way provide a simple way to get started. They don't require much experience to be worked on.
- [![Help wanted](https://img.shields.io/github/issues/cockatrice/cockatrice/Help%20Wanted)](https://github.com/Cockatrice/Cockatrice/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen%20is%3Aissue%20label%3A%22Help%20Wanted%22%20)<br>
This tag is used for issues that we are looking for somebody to pick up. Often this is for feature suggestions we support, but don't have the time to work on ourselves.

For both tags, we're willing to provide help to contributors in showing them where and how they can make changes, as well as code reviews for submitted changes.<br>
We'll happily advice on how best to implement a feature, or we can show you where the codebase is doing something similar before you get too far along - put a note on an issue you want to discuss more on!

Cockatrice tries to use the [Google Developer Documentation Style Guide](https://developers.google.com/style/) to ensure consistent documentation. We encourage you to improve the documentation by suggesting edits based on this guide.

### Translations [![Transifex Project](https://img.shields.io/badge/translate-on%20transifex-brightgreen)](https://transifex.com/cockatrice/cockatrice/)

Cockatrice uses Transifex to manage translations. You can help us bring <kbd>Cockatrice</kbd>, <kbd>Oracle</kbd> and <kbd>Webatrice</kbd> to your language and just adjust single wordings right from within your browser by visiting our [Transifex project page](https://transifex.com/cockatrice/cockatrice/).<br>

Check out our [Translator FAQ](https://github.com/Cockatrice/Cockatrice/wiki/Translation-FAQ) for more information about getting invovled, and join a group of hundreds of others!<br>


# Build [![CI Desktop](https://github.com/Cockatrice/Cockatrice/actions/workflows/desktop-build.yml/badge.svg?branch=master&event=push)](https://github.com/Cockatrice/Cockatrice/actions/workflows/desktop-build.yml?query=branch%3Amaster+event%3Apush) [![CI Docker](https://github.com/Cockatrice/Cockatrice/actions/workflows/docker-release.yml/badge.svg?branch=master&event=push)](https://github.com/Cockatrice/Cockatrice/actions/workflows/docker-release.yml?query=branch%3Amaster+event%3Apush) [![CI Web](https://github.com/Cockatrice/Cockatrice/actions/workflows/web-build.yml/badge.svg?branch=master&event=push)](https://github.com/Cockatrice/Cockatrice/actions/workflows/web-build.yml?query=branch%3Amaster+event%3Apush)

Dependencies: *(for minimum versions search our [CMake file](https://github.com/Cockatrice/Cockatrice/blob/master/CMakeLists.txt))*
- [Qt](https://www.qt.io/developers/)
- [protobuf](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf)
- [CMake](https://www.cmake.org/)

Oracle can *optionally* use some packages to load compressed card files:
- [xz](https://tukaani.org/xz/)
- [zlib](https://www.zlib.net/)

<br>

**Basic compilation steps:**
```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

You can then
 - Create a Cockatrice installation inside the `release` folder:
    ```bash
    make install
    ```
 - Or make an installation package specific to your system:
    ```bash
    make package
    ```

>[!NOTE]
>Detailed compiling instructions can be found in the Cockatrice wiki at [Compiling Cockatrice](https://github.com/Cockatrice/Cockatrice/wiki/Compiling-Cockatrice)

<br>

The following flags (with their non-default values) can be passed to `cmake`:
| Flag | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `-DWITH_SERVER=1` | Build <kbd>Servatrice</kbd> server |
| `-DWITH_CLIENT=0` | Don't build <kbd>Cockatrice</kbd> client |
| `-DWITH_ORACLE=0` | Don't build <kbd>Oracle</kbd> card database tool |
| `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug` | Compile in debug mode<br> Enables extra logging output, debug symbols, and much more verbose compiler warnings |
| `-DWARNING_AS_ERROR=0` | Don't treat compilation warnings as errors in debug mode |
| `-DUPDATE_TRANSLATIONS=1` |  Configure `make` to update the translation .ts files for new strings in the source code<br> **Note:** `make clean` will remove the .ts files |
| `-DTEST=1` | Enable regression tests<br> **Note:** `make test` to run tests, *googletest* will be downloaded if not available |
| `-DFORCE_USE_QT5=1` | Skip looking for Qt6 before trying to find Qt5 |


# Run

<kbd>Cockatrice</kbd> is the game client<br>
<kbd>Oracle</kbd> fetches card data<br>
<kbd>Servatrice</kbd> is the server<br>

#### Docker

You can build an image & deploy a <kbd>Servatrice</kbd> (Cockatrice server) container using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container/) and our Dockerfile yourself.<br>

For more details, look into our wiki section on [Setting up Servatrice](https://github.com/Cockatrice/Cockatrice/wiki/Setting-up-Servatrice#using-docker).<br>
You'll also find more hints on our **pre-build image** there, or the **docker-compose** file which will configure and run both a MySQL server and Servatrice.
