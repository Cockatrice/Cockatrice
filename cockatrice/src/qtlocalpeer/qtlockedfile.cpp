 \ class QtLockedFile   *
 \brief The QtLockedFile class extends QFile with advisory locking functions.
 A file may be locked in read or write mode. Multiple instances of
 \e QtLockedFile, created in multiple processes running on the same
 machine, may have a file locked in read mode. Exactly one instance
 may have it locked in write mode. A read and a write lock cannot
 exist simultaneously on the same file.
 The file locks are advisory. This means that nothing prevents
 another process from manipulating a locked file using QFile or
 file system functions offered by the OS. Serialization is only
 guaranteed if all processes that access the file use
 QtLockedFile. Also, while holding a lock on a file, a process
 must not open the same file again (through any API), or locks
 can be unexpectedly lost.
 The lock provided by an instance of \e QtLockedFile is released
 whenever the program terminates. This is true even when the
 program crashes and no destructors are called.

 be acquired.

 of a different type than \a mode, the lock is first released and then a new lock is obtained. This function returns \e
